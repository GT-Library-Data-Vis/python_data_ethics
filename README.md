# python_data_ethics
A workshop on python for data ethics.

## COMPAS Analysis
This COMPAS Analysis uses a dataset compiled by ProPublica to analyze the COMPAS algorithm, an algorithm used by Northpointe to predict a defendant’s likelihood of recidivism. 
Data
The data is comprised of COMPAS score data from the Broward County’s Sheriff’s Office in Florida in 2013 and 2014, public criminal records from the Broward Conty Clerk’s Office website, jail records from the Broward County Sheriff's Office, and public incarceration records from the Florida Department of Corrections website.
The dataset is available on the ProPublica Github: https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis
